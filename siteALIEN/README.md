# Cinesite
This is an HTML only Group project made during my FullStack Web dev training
The purpose of this exercise was to learn HTML before switching to CSS.
The theme of this website was Halloween, for a "cinema club" inviting their members to vote among a selection of movies and therefore choose the ones to project during a said Halloween event.
